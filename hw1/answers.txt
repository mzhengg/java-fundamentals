A.2: Can π be encoded as “static final” in the code? Why or why not? Justify your answer.


Static means that the value is the same for every instance of the class. Final means that once the variable has been assigned a value it can't be changed. So, static final is how one creates a constant value in Java. Thus, π can be encoded as a static final since it is always 3.14...


D.1: Explain the problem:


The equation written by the physics student doesn't follow orders of operations. Note that (G*m1*m2/r)*r, which is what the student is doing, is not equivalent to G*m1*m2/(r^2), which is how the equation should be used.
